                The cashier was very rude and she didn't give me the receipt, I think she did that on purpose, because I was going to see her name (she didn't have name badge either), and she knew I was going tocomplain of her service in KFC in the intersection of Bethel Rd. and Olentagy Rd in RdColumbus, Ohio. Also the food was cool and salty.

                KFC Hayward's Heath. Tasteless, dried up, chicken fillet that barely covered half the equally tasteless bun, slimy lettuce, slimy mayo, presented in a ""slid off"" style with undercooked, floppy, lukewarm,  awful chips, no salt, napkin or hand wipe in the bag. Binned it. Whats happened to this iconic takeaway. The Colonel would be sobbing!!! Will not visit ever again.

                KFC, Ore Village, Hastings. If I could have awarded zero I would have done. Only the second visit in last six months but found at both times that the staff were both surly and unhelpful.  The whole meal was cold once again and the chicken was overcooked tasteless and like eating cardboard. The 'sides' of beans and congealed rice were also cold and bad quality.  Quite frankly the whole meal was inedible and went into the bin.  Never again!!

                I went into KFC in Prosser WA yesterday to get a large order for us and extended family.  I pulled up to the drive through and immediately was asked what I wanted, I said I need a minute, 30 seconds later I was asked again so I said we would like the full meal deal but could we get popcorn chicken instead of tenders, reply was abruptly no! I offered to pay more, no we don't do that! Ok well let me look. Again right away what do you want! Well we would like the full meal deal, extra crispy, reply it will take a minimum of 30 minutes, were busy so probably more! Ok I said could we get KFC sauce for the tenders? No we are out of it! Ok ranch. We pulled up to the window, she had our order, we paid and left. Chicken was cold, tenders were hard, biscuits were hard. We will never go there again!

There was absolutely no taste or spices at all. It was not like I remember KFC being.  For $9.29 it was not good at all. We will not go back at all.

Wings even colder they were half cooked. Not going back for my wings. I'm going for a full refund. Yum and PepsiCo need to take a hard look at there restaurants cause pizza hut and taco bell have just as bad of service.

                        KFC should discontinue online ordering
                ","
                KFC should discontinue online ordering. On Saturday 3/13/21 at 10:10 AM I ordered about $60.00 (and paid online) lunch to be picked up at 11 AM (pickup confirmed (355952) by KFC). When I arrived to pick up order at 10:53 AM; I was asked to sit and wait. The location I picked up at had only 3 or 4 employees and they were sending my order out the door with drive through customers. I waited over an hour watching walkin's and drive ups receiving my order. Note: when I arrived they began getting my order of sides ready. They set for the hour while continuing to take care of other customers. I did not complain because the staff was overwhelmed. But it did ruin my mother's 85th birthday lunch I had planned at 12. We didn't eat until 1 PM due to the fact that she lives about 30 miles from the pick up location. I do not think the manager or employees should be at fault. I believe a full refund plus extra because of the long wait (and part of my order was wrong). I would not accept the sides that had been setting for an hour. Love your food; but not your online ordering process.

                I placed an order a few days ago via the KFC app that was cancelled on their end. I received the following text: 'Hi ..., your order from KFC Maroochydore has been cancelled because we are unable to process the order with the restaurant'. The order also showed up as cancelled in the KFC app.The app tracked the delivery driver (they use DoorDash to deliver food) to the shop and after about 20 minutes or so, the order was cancelled. I rang the store and they were not busy, with them saying there were quite a few delivery orders being picked up, so I'm assuming the cancelled order came from the DoorDash moron (maybe he was chasing a higher paid fare).I've attempted to contact KFC via their website contact form multiple times, and no reply from them. Provided all relevant info like date, order #, PayPal transaction ID etc.No refund. I'm out $45. Scam

                DISAPPOINTING KFC CHICKEN SANDWICH. I just tried the new kfc spicy chicken sandwich.  I have to say I was disappointed.  The chicken was a good size and crispy but, it was rather bland in taste. It didn't taste like kfc chicken usually does. The seasoning was off. There wasn't enough of the sauce to make a difference. The old chicken sandwich is better. If you are trying to compete with the other chicken sandwich, you got a ways to go. Please flavor the chicken better and add more sauce to the bun.

So I order the 12 piece meal and a 24 piece wing and they were frozen. At this point I just went with a 12 piece meal and tried to get to sides of macaroni and cheese and that was frozen. So when I finally got home to eat the chicken is so over done and greasy its ridiculous. This was at 6:19pm they don't close until 10:30pm not sure how they make money when everything is frozen why offer it on the menu.Only wish I could attach the picture to show you how bad the chicken looks.

                I want to give a good review but just can’t. I went to KFC in Provo for lunch one day and was shorted chicken! I couldn’t go back because my lunch was over but essentially I paid $10 for 2 pieces of chicken. So today on my way home from work I stopped at the American Fork one and they didn’t give me all my change!!!! Twice in four days I’ve been shorted by KFC. At this rate, their chicken should be a lot cheaper because they either shortchange you on money or what chicken you do buy.  I’m now done with KFC and I’ll find another place that doesn’t rip me off every single time I go.

                Stopped at KFC yesterday. TERRIBLE food! Don't waste yr money. We bought 10 pc meal with mac & cheese and mash potatoes. All the food was like it had been cooked a week ago and it was just heated up. Mac & cheese was a glob of broken up smashed noodles. Had no taste if all! The chicken was stringy and tasteless it was OLD! This was the KFC in Lake Orion on 24.  Absolutely  terrible and it cost us $39 for a 12pc family meal. Plus we got an extra mac & cheese! What a waste!

Went to pick it up,in the drive through, they we a little busy but again, no problem. Paid for the order and started down the road  to my Dad's house about 30 minutes away.  I told my husband it didn't look like enough food so I checked the bags and sure enough no chicken tenders and no sauce. I was made because now I had to return to the restaurant, wait in line               again and I didn't want to  be late!  I called to let them know and the response was,""oh sorry about that, you could come back and get them""!  Of course I was coming back.  I didn't want to, I had to.  My point is, do your job right the first time. They gave me three little cookies for my trouble...WOW. This is the third time this happened and there is only 1 KFC in town! I'll order somewhere else next time.

                The KFCs in Boise are terrible.  They get the order wrong more than half the time.  They almost never have enough extra crispy chicken made to fill up a 12 piece bucket.  Often I have to wait 20 minutes or more to get some.  Tonight it was over 1 1/2 hours till closing and the manager told me they weren't planning to make any more chicken tonight, so I couldn't even wait for extra crispy.  She said that she could give me half extra and half the other, when I got home 4 out of 12 pieces were extra crispy, so her definition of half is suspect.  I'd already given up on the other locations in the area and now it's clear that this is a management problem with the company that owns all the KFCs in the area.  Never again.

                We wanted to try KFC again, after many years of not having it. I tried calling my local one at 4721 Morse Rd here in Gahanna, OH (43230). Tried calling them four times and the phone rang about a dozen times then went to a busy signal. OK, so forget it, I'll go to Cane's (Raising Canes) instead. When I got there I found about 20-25 cars waiting in line. So I decided to try KFC after all. Went there and there were only two cars ahead of me. I placed my order and they told me to pull around to the front door and they'd bring it out. I did, waited five minutes or so and they brought it out. Went home and opened it up. I'd ordered the 12 piece crispy meal and two extra pieces of original recipe. It was all mashed together and coming apart. The crunchy was soggy and overcooked. The original recipe was nowhere to be found but I think they mashed it into the 12 piece bucket, which, by the way had a puddle of grease at the bottom. There was no receipt either. They did charge me what I thought would be the charge, but it definitely wasn't worth it. Now I know why all the cars were at Canes and not KFC. I'll never go to KFC again.

I ordered 20 pieces and large fries.  the fries were surprisingly OK, considering KFC fries are usually like soggy worms. The chicken was a different story.  They changed the cut and now pieces are not recognizable.  The first bite was a wing and the bones were all shattered.  Into the trash it went.  The drumstick was OK, but drumstick number 2 had the big bone broken.  Do they buy seconds or do they abuse their birds?  I have 16 pieces left and am scared to bite into them.

                ","
                On Cyber Monday, my family and I attempted to order our meal from KFC. We placed it successfully at 532pm with an approximate wait time of 60 minutes. I called guest services at around 8pm because our food had still not arrived. We gave a huge amount of leeway knowing full well the restaurant is probably inundated with orders. I was on hold for an hour an 20 minutes and finally spoke to someone for about 20 seconds. She asked if I wanted a refund or to contact the restaurant about the order. I said please contact the restaurant. She put me on hold again and never came back. I was on hold for 4 hours and was cut off because that was likely the maximum time limit for the call to be on. FOUR Hours. No food. No resolution. During this wait, I received an email from KFC asking me to rate the satisfaction of my order. How dare you. I called back again the nextday, waited another 30 minutes and asked to speak to a supervisor about my experience. I was given a case number and my information was taken down. No timelines were given to me because she claimed they were receiving a lot of calls as a result of cyber Monday. Big surprise there. Wednesday I call guest services again to follow up with my case and ask for a follow up. No support or help there beyond a superficial apology for my experience. She stated guest services does not process refunds, the locations do. So I had her confirm for me whether I can go directly to the location to sort this out to which answered yes. I went to 636 bloor street west in Toronto and spoke to Raman. He advised me he could not process a refund as it was placed online, even if it was to this location. Way to defer responsibility, just ushering your problem from one place to another.. Anyways, he did say he would call guest services himself to sort it out and call me by EOD yesterday. I did not receive a call yesterday. I called guest services again this morning and they were completely unhelpful once again. They claim it is not possible to transfer me to the resolution team or field leadership team. All they can say is they have a case number for me and cannot provide me a timeline of when I will get a callback, which I have requested now 3 times, 3 days in a row. She did confirm for me, however, that the location itself is who processes the refund. I will be paying the location a visit again today. The guest service operation should be able to provide WAY more support and information to customers than they do. As someone who has worked in a customer service role answering hotline calls and emails for 7 plus years, it is absolutely mind numbingly horrible. I am not asking for an outlandish request; just what is mine. I would like the money back for meal that we literally never physically received. It is money that you did not earn and that you do not deserve. This is one family you are losing business from for good and to the best of my power, any time I can, I will share this experience with anyone who will listen to deter them from being your customer.

                Today Nov 30th I purchased a 14 meal deal from your steels and Kennedy. I will be honest I have not bought KFC for about 2 to 3 years as I have had bad experiences in the past but I got an email on your cyber Monday special which my wife and kids wanted to use as it looked appealing and something put of the ordinarybfpr us.Unfortunately I was very disappointed to receive only 2 pieces of white meat (2 wings ) when I picked up my order I asked what the standard bucket consist off and to see that what they gave me was not close was upsetting to top it off also 4 out of the 14 pieces were undercooked because the breading on it was white and to top it off I asked for the biscuits to get 2 of them frozen. When I tried to contact the store they answered and mentioned that they were too busy cant help which I dont disagree with them they were busy even when I went in but to be put off and not care to hear me out is very upsetting. I also tried to get someone on guest services the first time we got disconnected which I believe we did because weather was not favorable and second time I waited for 20 minutes and gave up. As a heads up to people double check your order in the car or in the store so you dont end up at home with the same disappointment we did.

                KFC Norwood, Ohio 11-17-2020: Drive thru ordering was fine. We have been occasional customers for years. Food was always tasty and good quality. However, this time the chicken was ""tasteless"". The seasoning was obviously omitted from their famous recipe chicken. Also, the mashed potatoes were made with water not milk & butter. (They may be instant) Don't think I will be going back. Disappointed!

                Went to KFC in Palm Harbor to pick up dinner around 5 PM on Saturday. Go through drive thru and they came over intercom to say they have no chicken, and had a few sides to pick from. This makes the second time I've been there and no food. What a joke, if you cant keep food close the restaurant. Then went to KFC in Holiday, Fl hoping they would have chicken. Luckily they did, got home and never seen or tasted chicken so bad, overcooked. When you go to these restaurants to get dinner for your family and you expect quality and you get crap. I will not be going back to a KFC!!!

                ","
                Now I remember why I don't go to KFC anymore. My husband wanted to order a medium or a large popcorn chicken. They said they only had large and extra large so he thought we'll get a large and we'll share it. But when I got the box it was what they used to call a small. So apparently now the size has changed names. Also when I opened the box most of it had chunks of breading. Not chunks of chicken but chunks of breading. And they were very hard and very crunchy. Not much chicken in the whole box. To top it off for the large mashed potatoes that I ordered was put it in one of those bowls that they put a meal in and I don't know if they do that to kind of fool you into how much they're giving you but it doesn't look like a large mashed potato to me because they only put it about a third full. And I know for a fact that the large gravy that we ordered is not the right size because large gravies were much taller so they ripped us off all around . Looks like they gave a smalls for all the larges that we ordered and the popcorn chicken wasn't edible. I used to love KFC above all other chickens places. Obviously it's gone so far downhill that I can't eat there anymore. I took pics but apparently this site doesn't let you post them.

                We chose the 20 dollar family meal with 20 chicken fingers. The mashed potatoes were cold but we heated them in the microwave. I didn’t receive the honey mustard dip. I never counted the number of chicken fingers but 8 of them seemed like they were days old. So tough they couldn’t be eaten. The biscuits were good. This KFC is only 6 blocks from my house in Gladstone, MO. I can buy better chicken fingers from the grocery store. This isn’t the first time I’ve had inferior product from KFC but it will be the last. I will not return to any KFC in the future. Sad.

One of the thigh pieces was undercooked and pink/red inside.  Extremely greasey.  The thighs did have a biscuit but the tenders did not.  I’m not sure the tenders were cooked today and the receipt showed dip but none included. They were dry and hard.  Very disappointed in the whole experience and will not patronize KFC anytime soon.

                I've been a KFC customer for over half a century, the Lindsay, Ontario location on Kent St. is the only one I've ever been unsatisfied with. I normally have KFC twice a week, I no-longer do, now, only when I'm out of town. Before the new manager took over, even if you were the only customer there, it would always take 20 to 30 minutes to get your food, ""after"" you ordered, often, there was three or four other cars in line, one or two would always give up and leave the line. The last three times in a row, I received the wrong order, and/or had food items missing. If you order a meal with dark meat, specify ""NO WHITE MEAT"" or half your order will be; old, dried out white meat, that's to tough, even for my dog's and cat's to eat! I went to KFClistens.ca, and no one listened, no one got back to me about the problems I had at this location.

Thinking that surely I did not hear her correctly, I said  ""What?"", and she repeated ""I done told you"". I asked if she could repeat them since I did not hear her. I was so taken aback, that I thought about canceling my order and getting my money back. I should have. The tenders were dry and over cooked, seemed to be left over from lunchtime. It was the worst meal I have had in quite a long time. I will never visit a KFC again.

                The KFC in Hackettstown on Mountain Ave. was horrible! There was a car in front of me waiting to order and had to ask if someone was there and the response was please wait! The car took off after 5 minutes of waiting! I pulled up next and had to say anyone there and gave my order twice. When I got to the window to pick it up I over heard the guy saying why is she being so grumpy. I told the guy I over heard him and there was no reason for the women in front of me to take off when there was no other customer. Plus for him saying I was grumpy! That they are a business and need to take care of costumers! I will not be doing business there again!!!

                KFC Dewsbury is pure rubbish. I love KFC when done right. I can only assume the dewsbury branch are penny pinching.  After ordering a 6 piece bargain bucket for delivery it turned up with 3 drumsticks, 2 thighs and 1 yup just 1 piece of chicken breast.  This happens every time with this branch so I have had enough.  I will vote with my feet. I think its down to the owners.  Poor Poor Poor

                I donated to KFC cause when asked if I wanted to donate and then was given a coupon book. I could not use it until the first of October 2020. When I went to use a 12 pc meal coupon I saved 4.00,but they in turn made up that 4.00 by only filling the two gravy containers 1/2 full which was a tad over 1/2 cup combined and the two mashed potatoes were only half full.I feel this is unfair treatment to their customers.This was in Waynesboro,PA. I will never donate again as I feel I was ripped off in doing so. Poor service I guess because I had recently given them a bad survey for the greasy chicken and not getting what I paid for. I asked for green beans and got mac and cheese. I asked for three thighs and got three legs. Why ask customers what they want when she gives you what she feels like giving you.I love the KFC food and rarely miss a Saturday and Sunday and often throughout the week,but new people are working there and give bad service.They use to be the best KFC around,can't say that anymore. There are two people who are managers that still gives you great fresh food and friendly service and makes you feel like family named Savannah and Aaron,but when they are not there it is not that great of a place to eat.I will take photos of my food from now on as I carry out and eat at home.

                The food at KFC is not for human consumption at this point.  I have given KFC too many times to redeem themselves by complaining and even getting the meal remade to no avail.  The chicken is the worst.  The chicken strips tastes like rubber and the bone in chicken has so much filler I can't even look at it after I have bitten a piece.  The cole slaw was was runny and the gravy looks like dirty water. I just do not under any circumstances want to subject myself to this nasty food anymore.  I will not go back and I will not complain anymore after today.  I release myself from food meant for animals not humans.

Rather than making a second order for missing item and continuing to wait, I decided to cut my losses and leave. The sandwich was inedible - I threw it in the garbage. The fries were palatable but cold and flavourless. Now I remember why I eat KFC only once every 10 years!

                I spent $80 on food from KFC which included two large gravy. The gravies were inedible. It had the most awful taste and texture. My sandwiches I got, I asked for extra mayo and when I returned home, there was hardly any on them at all. If you're paying 30 cents per sandwich for extra mayo, put the extra mayo on. I took the gravies back and the manager told me this is how they make the gravy now. I asked him to taste it himself but he refused. I would not have gone down there to cause a stink had the gravies not been as terrible as they were. And when I say they were inedible. They were inedible. I had 6 people here. Not one person said they could tolerate the taste. This is now my third experience at KFC where they do not fulfill orders correctly, don't add extra sauce even though I'm paying for it, and have given me gravy that is absolutely disgusting. Their macaroni salad also continues to get soupier and soupier. Everything has been a disappointment. Spend $80 on food from there, you'd expect a decent meal. Never going back there again unless something can be rectified. The manager was rude when I asked for my money back for the gravies alone. You can't sell trash and expect $80.

                I ordered a 4 piece tender combo and a crispy Colonel Buffalo sandwich. unfortunately the tenders where soggy and gross and the fries wasn't much better just as soggy as the tenders. not to mention the biscuit was crumbled into a ball. My buffalo colonel sandwich was a signal tender and had no buffalo added to it. This has been the 3rd time I've tried this KFCs and i have nothing positive to say about there services. hopeful something will change and they can get the store in order as of now i won't be eating at the restaurant any more

                I often go to KFC on central Florida parkway in Orlando FL. I had stopped going bc of bad experiences but a few years ago they changed mng and I fell in love w their crispy chicken again. I believe Janette is her name short hair shaved on sides. She Always shows the love to each of us. Last time I went she made sure my complicated, high maintenance order was perfect and she bagged it w all the sauces and plates we needed.  Felt like Christmas. Her care made me feel sooo cared for. And the chicken was great. Nobody does fried chicken like u guys.

                I would rate it zero stars if I could. Last week I went to the drive thru and asked for a number 2 meal but without the drink. The lady over the cloud speaker never responded so I continued waiting in line and finally got to the window,  the lady greeted me and told me the price.  I then asked if she heard that I wanted the meal without the drink. She said ""I'm sorry sir, the drink is included in the price of the meal"". I then repeated I don't want the drink and I don't want to be forced to pay for a drink. She then brought her manager to the window who was rude and she basically said ""if you don't want your drink may I suggest you go eat somewhere else?"" She then shut the window on me. If this is a marketing strategy, tell someone up in corporate that it's bad business.No customer should be forced to order something that they don't want. If you wanna give everyone free drinks that's great. But I would just like my meal please............WITHOUT A DRINK!

Instead I got two very large breast. On the second order I had a 5 dollar fill up. The chicken was soaked in grease on one side there was so much grease that it coated the bottom of the box. When I called the store to talk to the manager I was put on hold for 37 minutes and then was hung up on. The phone was off the hook until closing I don't plan to go back. I do plan to call the store again, soon.

When I tried to do so, I was informed that ""my zone"" was out of range. So long, so good, KFC. Much as I like your food, if you cannot buy it, you cannot eat it.

                I placed an order last night and when I received my order it had been put into the cardboard container in a complete mess.I am SO disappointed in the new gravy also. It is runny, has NO flavor and is absolutely gross.The quality of the food has totally taken a dive in both flavor and appearance. This used to be my favorite chicken and BY FAR my favorite gravy but now I am absolutely disappointed in the quality and the taste.

                We ordered the $20 fill up with an extra Mac and cheese. Got home, no biscuits. Instead of of the coleslaw we ordered, we got green beans. I HATE green beans. I called the store immediately and no one would pick up the phone. Literally let it ring until the phone disconnected automatically. After trying to call 3 times I finally called the Customer service number. Filed a complaint. Responded to survey on my receipt and also stated the problem. That was 06/14/20. As of today, I have heard nothing! I called the customer service number again who was able to find my complaint and they said they would resend it. Really?!!!!! KFC does not care about its customers. Two months and no response! I haven't spent a dime with them since this happened, they obviously don't want my business. My food was incomplete and wrong and no one cares to make it right. Not only has their quality diminished but their loyalty to their customers is non-existent. Spend your money with the competition, at least they will get your order correct. My family used to eat here once a week but haven't spent a dime since this happened. Run away!

                This is for KFC in San Javier, Murcia, Spain. There was only one member of staff who worked really hard and was rushing around as other staff including a number who were in the way but had no uniform on with children and even a baby behind the counter.  The staff member was trying her best but did not actually fill our order.. We ordered 12 pieces of strips but only got 10 very small and the chips were awful and a small bag each - The lady did try her best as she was doing a lot of other work while trying to serve us and is a credit to your company but not everybody else mostly who were just standing around but then I guess nobody cares so with the short coming in what we ordered and not received and we did not get what we ordered so I do not think we will be back. The drinks had no flavouring as nearly all were just plain soda water.  In this day and age and Covid 19 nobody behind the counter apart from our server was sanitising their hands - they just walked around touching everything including the bins and no sanitising.  Never going back again - surprised they have not been closed down!!!!!!

I have been dining there 40 years But today is the last. I think when you call corporate they lie and say they will take care of it when really they don’t care either or these kfc stores wouldn’t be like they are. I also think they will hire just anyone now.  People who don’t care....people looking for a job for money. Also your Forced to give them at least one star or else you can’t leave a review. How do I give you no stars?

Machine was not working.so no drink with food and no desert for children. 3. There were 2 out of 4 toaletts out of order. 4. The 3d toalet was without paper and disgustingly smelly while the 4th one was just impossibly messy and dirty.  Haven't been at that store for a year and will not go for another 2 years.

And the page does not close until you give feedbackIn next few minutes I got a call from a delivery boy named Hamid around 11:40 and told sir you will receive in 10 mts . Again the wait started ..For another 20 mts I waited and still no delivery . I called both the guy who initially called me for order and the delivery guy. both irresponsible  did not attended my callsAtlast I had to call the customer service .A guy named Usman who seemed to be helpful told me initially that it was a mistake that order dispatched different store and he told he immediately transfer the order to correct store After 5 mts the guy ( mr nice ) Usman called me again telling it is not possible to transfer the order by now the time was 12 :20  and he asked to cancel the order I cancelled as per his device and I went personally to a near by store to place a pick up order ,order number - 52582227Guy told ( Mr nice) told I will receive my refund in 24 hours.

                Went here a year ago and was charged $6.50 for the 5 buck boxes we ordered. I was told the internet prices were wrong. Waited a year to go back and apparently it was too soon. Still sh!+ service. Ordered online. Got there and waited 20 minutes outside for my order. They served the other 3 cars that pulled up after I did before they served me. Got home and checked my order. 8 peices consisted of 4 tiny legs, 2 wings I think and 2 thighs that were ripped apart. When we called the girl refused to let us speak to the manager because she said he was busy. She then told us she couldn't do anything for us because we placed our order online.  Will never go back and will tell everyone I know about this sh!+hole. Update.... So after making a complaint to kfc corporate the so called manager Maria called us and apologized and offered to replace our meal. 3 days in a row we've tried but keep getting a run around from Daniel the so called ASSistant manager claiming he has no idea who we are and the manager is not in. Do not go to this sh!+hole. They have complete !diots working there. Its a waste of your time and money.

YOU COULD STARVE TO DEATH WAITING ON YOUR ORDER.When I finally got home with the bag they brought to the car I found instead of extra crispy I got extra soggy.  I ordered and paid for an extra container of slaw but only got one container.  The 12 piece bucket promised 6 biscuits but the box only contained 4.  Complaints sent to KFC appear to be assigned a ""Case number"" so they can be ignored in the order recieved.  I've sent in three complaints, recieved 3 case numbers but nothing more.

                The wait time is ridiculous for food that tastes like cardboard. The employees are rude when someone walks thru the door when they are either just opening, or like 45 minutes from closing. They dont properly clean the tables or anything in there. Ive ended up with food poisoning more then once from eating there. Never eat there if you like flavour in your food and having an a**hole

                Horribly rude and long wait time. The location on Mansfield rd in Shreveport La showcased deplorable behavior. Acted so afraid of Covid 19 that they tried dropping my change a foot above my hand in the window and had me pull up to wait on my food at the door for 20 minutes while shaking hands with the African American man in the car after me. The double standard was glaring, unsafe and frankly a bit rascist. This chain has a serious problem and I certainly won’t be coming back.

Got in drive thru line at 4:40 @ 5:05 reached the window. I was told it would be a few more minutes and to pull up. Got our wings at 5:20. Young man behind the window was super nice. KFC has bigger problems. It has been 10 years since I tried KFC , will be much longer this time. Hello Popeyes!!

                Don't waste your money on KFC hot wings. I ordered the 12 pack with 2 orders of fries deliv red through Uber eats, it cost $23 dollars. When I received it I was missing an order of fries and 4 wings. The other wings were the size of a small chicken nugget, dried out, and rubbery like they had being sitting under a heat lamp all day. When I called KFC and they acted like it was no big deal, so I assume this is how they usually operate, won't be shopping there again. Thankfully UberEats reimbursed me.

Then when then do return with it more than half is spilled in the bag. I mean its horrible service and when you complain is like they most upset!!! We are paying money not getting it for free.

But the spit in the face they gave me by sending me a damn $20 check basically telling me, “oh well!” TF why I don’t eat at SH IT holes like this place! He wanted to go is the ONLY REASON why tf I gave them a chance!!!! Not only did they really mess up and jeopardize my life’s breath and well being but gave me a slap in the face!!!! They will so apologize when I have a lawyer call the CEO!!!! So if you have any allergy you should skip this place because they surely don’t give a crap if they kill you!!!!

My total cost was $58.12.The order was placed at 6.30pm online, ETA was 8.31, actual delivery time was 8.50pm. I could forgive the longer wait time as it was Mother's Day, however after the driver left I checked our order, not one piece of white meat chicken it was 4 drumsticks and 4 wings, no coleslaw or potato salad, instead 2 containers of macaroni salad, Neither of the sauces we ordered they gave us 3 honey mustard, We do not eat dark chicken meat, we do not eat macaroni salad, we do not eat mustard. On top of that, the food that was delivered was cold! I will never order online, drve through or anything else from KFC. I tried calling both the 1866 # and the store telephone, I was on hold for 15 mins on the 1866 and I gave up, I then tried calling the store it was busy after 15 mins of trying that number I gave up. They can have their cold wings and drumsticks back and their salads. I am so angry, to charge people $58.12 for this sub standard service is disgusting! My order number was 051020-223143-1516-4931 I want my money back.

They never speak and get mad if you bring it back. I ordered a #16 and i just threw it away. The popcorn chicken was hard. I coudn't even put a real fork in it. It was crunchy. Smh They will give you food no matter how long it has been sitting there. Rule of thumb never give anyone food you wouldn't eat yourself. I have said thia before but i will NEVER eat there again.

They put it in smaller containers now. Same with the large coleslaw.  I ordered 1 large coleslaw and 2 individual.  The 2 small individual equaled what they have me in the large.  I paid $4.16 for a large gravy.  I got a small styrofoam container.  If you're going to make your things smaller, at least lower your prices. You are already one of the priciest fast food places. There is no need to RIP off your customers. I guess I just dont get it.

I looked more closely and realized that they didn't season the chicken and by the way I ordered a leg and thigh bucket and got a regular box.  The smashed potatoes had lumps of instant potatoes in the potatoes and was not mixed enough; I had to throw them away.  The biscets were doughy inside and had to throw them away also and my cole slaw never was in the bag.  Horrible Stay away from this place...

They will not hand you the order through the pick up window for online orders. If you order online, to make things at the restaurant simple and easy, they make it more complicated after you get there. If you order at the drive through they will serve you in the drive through. So I will be doing that from now on. They offer online ordering but I don't think they understand the purpose.

                        Misleading & Wrong Information
                ","
                I had the worse experience with KFC. Lately, I placed an order 23:01 pm at night and it gave me an estimated time of delivery 27 minutes but I waited much longer and it as 1 hour and I called the customer service number to track my order and I was misled that it was raining and its late as I rushed to my balcony and it was not. Plus the customer service agent Mr. Abdul Rahman said that my order was cancelled from one branch and is forwarded to another brand and I have to place it and then apologized that that info was wrong but apparently that was not the case.I then received the meals around 1:30am which is 1 hour 30 minutes duration and this experience caused my kids to sleep without food plus I was left with no choice of taking that order and to my notice I saw Fries were cold to which I called the concern branch and Mr. Hassan from muweilah branch had it replaced but the driver who came for delivery he had no gloves which is really unacceptable.I spoke with the following day with Mr. Wael and he listen to my concern and was assured to receive a call from Area Manager but till date I am still waiting for a call for the whole customer experience which I believe leaves me in never ordering and telling all my peers about this experience.I want to see how is a customer served with this type of customer service and I would need some compensation so this never happens to anyone else.Awaiting for some inputRegards,Mohammad Anas Sahibzada0566524665

                Ordered a 12 pc. Feast VERY pricey w/o a coupon. Salads were wrong sizes and barely filled up. Should have been medium salads. Don’t think 2, 3/4 filled small salads make up for a medium. Chicken has gone down-hill. A lot of wings, small, twisted barely recognizable pieces that seemed less tasty and less seasoned. I even added some bagel spice and a touch of salt to help it and the fries along!Gravy was ok. I highly doubt we order from KFC again. Just not good nor worth the price. Too bad... used to love it.

                Many of us as kids always got excited when our parents bought KFC for dinner. I remember those juicy pieces and that lovely skin covering. Unfortunately KFC here in Canada has screwed up one of the two. Seeking greater profits they now cut each thigh into two. The beeast also yields an extra piece. While there is more covering of the mixture the meat is now very dry. The quality is not there anymore. The price of KFC lacks value. A whole chicken costs $4 wholesale at most so keeping this in mind their prices have grown substantially. A chicken used to be cut into 10 pieces vs today's 14.

                I never eat KFC. But my wife talked me into going there for a $20 fillup meal.  So, I googled KFC and the food looked great. I was expecting some good looking, tasty chicken. I went through the drive thru Friday February 21, 2020 @((corner of White Horse rd. and Blue Ridge dr. Greenville, SC 29611)) and placed my order. I ordered 12 piece chicken tenders, 2 large mashed potatoes and gravy, 1 large cole slaw, and biscuits. I also  ordered a large order of potato wedges for the kids. I didn’t check the bag. When I got home with the food there was no biscuits, I also asked for honey for my biscuits. Anyhow, we didn’t get our biscuits and the chicken was so dried out and some of it was hard as a brick. I didn’t have time to go back to KFC because we had plans to go to the Monster truck show. I was just disappointed with the overall customer service and the food. I attempted to eat a piece of chicken and it was so dry hard and rubbery. I hope you guys at KFC don’t serve this nasty 🤢 food everyday. Because if you do I don’t know how u stay in business. I had doubts about eating there in the first place but I did anyway. And you guys let me down. I don’t think I’ll ever eat KFC again. I’d like a refund or a freshly prepared meal. Otherwise you lost customers for life. I know I said I never   eat KFC but my family loves it. I’ll convince them never to eat there again. I also want to point out that the lady manager that tooK my order was so rude to me when taking my order. Shame on you KFC.

                Recently visited KFC Bremerton Washington. Moved up here from just 30 miles from Corbin The home of KFC. In short mashed potatoes were water down and chicken bread mix was weak. Guess they do it better back home. Not sure the Great Northwest will ever know true 1960s KFC. You can't get a new generation to liking this New KFC. The colonial would roll in his grave. 😥

                ","
                I had a bad experience at your KFC Store located at 2390 Lewisville Clemmons Rd. Clemmons, NC.I placed two separate orders and the cashier told me she couldn't give me a receipt because the printer wasn't working. I was told that my order was complete. I left the store and on my way checked the bags and found out that I was missing my pot pie. I returned to the store and there were no customers in the store and no attendant at the counter so I called and the cashier came to the counter and I told her I was missing my pot pie from the order and she promptly told me I did not pay for it.  I asked her why did she charge me $10.65 for a reg. bowl and not include the pot pie. I reminded her that she did not give me a receipt and she started shouting at me and the cook in the kitchen called her to told her the pot pie was waiting to be picked up.  She did not apologize to me and handed me the pot pie.  I think she is out of order and should not be dealing with customers. She is definitely not an asset to KFC.  I will never go back to that store if that is the attitude of your cashier. I will never recommend anyone going to that store.

                I normally go to KFC and they do ok but for some reason today was not the same I place an order at around about 12:30 and my order was incorrect the managers response was that I needed to bring my food back so they could replace it.  Well being that I only get one lunch a day that was not an option.  Then when I took the food back both the managers had an attitude like I messed over then.  This company was so worried about their meal that they messed up on but never thought about the gas that we as customers spend to drive to their location.  I will NO longer eat at this KFC and thinking about not going to another.  As a customer I matter cause it's people like me that help keep youir business going.

Its was always a Sunday treat for the family we all loved it.Today employees at his chain restaurants are making him look bad. They never have some chicken parts,  NEVER get chicken after 5PM they have been under the heat lamp all day they do care to fry a fresh batch. Few days ago, I stopped to pick a meal,  the biscuits were not baked all the way through they were doughy, out shorted me a piece of chicken bucket was mostly breast and was too far away from home to go back. By the way, talking about Albuquerque NM area.

After a long wait , they manage to deliver the wrong order. We initially excused  them thinking they were new. But they continue to consistently repeat the deplorable performance week after week. If all of this was not enough, we spotted them using their bare hands to pack another customers chicken into a box. This is not a.place i will ever recommend to any one. I will probably never use this shop. The one star is only for the brand name, and becoz i have had better experience at some other kfc resturant elsewhere

When we use the drive through we always have to check our order once they have shut the window because something we ordered is always missing.  They also no longer salt the chips and unless you beg you never get salt or a single serviette, which is ridiculous when you are in the car with a takeaway.  Tonight it looked dead quiet but we queued for an age and when we got to the window it looked like only 2 people working.  Whilst we sat about 4 more people popped up but the service was dead slow and no one apologised for our wait.  This is not the same with other KFCs we are definitely using an alternative next time.

                Prefer not to give a star. Kfc is absolutely appalling. They served me an uncooked burger and all they have done for the past 6 months is argue with me, trying to explain that it was cooked. The customer service is appalling, they refuse to give me my money back, I have pictures of proof that the chicken is pink, slimy and tasted awful so no I did not eat it. I am so shocked how they treat their customers. No value whatsoever.

When the food did arrive it was someone else's order we told the driver who said I'm just the driver nothing to do with me!!! We have now had to drive to kfc and change the order where the staff are rude.. and make you feel it's your fault. How hard is it to read an order not the first time they've done this. Just eat dont care tell you to contact kfc but that's no use as they are absolute useless.

                Ordered £68 worth of KFC for a large family gathering/party. The order cane really quickly and very hot so this was good.However, the Margate branch decided to stuff all the order into one paper bag and it was so greasy and heavy that when the poor delivery person was bringing it to the door the bag gave way and a third of the order ended up on the floor on our doorstep. The delivery person apologised and handed the rest of the order over. We got him some kitchen roll to get the grease off his hands. He then just left and would not answer or offer a solution to our lost food, now in the bin. We rang the restaurant, as instructed by just eat who wanted little to do with it, and the store manager apologised and gave us a code to get the lost food back. We explained it was for a celebration large family meal and we needed the food replaced ASAP. He just said he was not able to send the delivery driver back with more as they were too busy! Now, had I ordered more food would he have refused the money and order because he could not deliver it? I doubt it! So what would be the difference in the driver bringing out replaced food back? Anyway he outright refused and we had to make do with what we had, which meant a good amount of us did not eat which spoiled the event, and were about £30 out of pocket from the food that was lost.Really poor service in this circumstance, not an acceptable solution offered and no concern for the fact that the loss of that food would mean a meal/event ruined.Doubt I will go back again 😡

                For the Meridian Street & 24th Street KFC in Indianapolis, this has to be the worst KFC in the country.  They probably lose more business than they do.  Every time I go there, they either have no chicken, drive-thru is closed, which is a great way to get people to just leave since the store is on a one way street or some other random excuse to not serve customers.  I’ve been there 4 times in the last month and have been served once.  It’s time for a new manager and employees of the owner of this store is ever gonna turn it’s reputation around.

                I just ordered 8 pieces with fries and 2 popcorn chicken poutines with a kids popcorn chicken barrel. I guess the guy wasn't listening to what I said. I ended up with a small fry. A large bucket of popcorn chicken. All the chicken I got was broken bones and missing skin? Ended up paying 50$ for a meal that I'd expect to find in the garbage can at KFC. KFC used to be an experience when you'd eat it. It's gross and disgusting now. Please fix your stuff KFC. You're losing business. I won't be going back. There is a lot of places that make chicken better now.. I should have gone there instead.

                Kfc isn't quite the same as it use to be, maybe it's hygene, maybe the quality of the materials aren't the same (cheaper). But one thing that does concern me is the delivery service. The bags need to be and should be sealed, as McDonald's do. Thank you for your time reading this.

                I just bought 20 bucks worth of food from KFC. It took more than 45 minutes for my food to be delivered to me. It wasn't busy at all. In fact, the only people in there were the workers. If KFC's service is like this, even on a rare, not busy day, then I'm never going there again. The food is good, don't get me wrong. But their service was NOT fast food. It was slow food is what it was. I could've drove to a different city and back and would still not have my food ready.

                Today I took my clients to  KFC in Upland, CA 1188 W Foothill Blvd.,Store # E791061. I work with disabled adults. A female client of mine ordered # 7 box. I ordered # 10.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and a drink. A female employee of KFC brought out the # 7 in a bag. My client ordered to dine in, not takeout. I asked which order this was and the female employee told me it was the sandwich combo. I gave this order to my male client thinking it was his order. We waited a long time for the # 7 order, and I went up to ask the female employee what happened to the # 7 order. She told me it was still being putting together. I later find out from the male employee, Matthew that they had already given me the # 7, and they brought out the male clien't order in a bag, when I had told the female employee, "" to eat in"". I ended having to buy my female  client another # 7 order, as they refused to make up another # 7 for free because of the pathetic female employee's mistake. Not only did they refuse to remedy the mistake, the male employee Matthew was rude to my female client when she told them they had made a mistake. I hope the owner of KFC Store # E791061 becomes aware of the way we were treated. Her employees are not only inept, but indifferent as well. i will never return there again.

I waited and eventually after 20 minutes I saw a girl stood at the door talking to another lady for at least 2 mins with some food orders in her hand. She then came to my car with my food order. I expressed my concern that my food would be cold due to her having a conversation at the door and that I had been waiting for 20 minutes. To which her reply was ""it's not got anything to do with me"" I think some of your staff should have an extra course in time keeping and customer service. This is not the first time I have had bad customer service this branch of kfc.

KFC does provide excellent fresh food. There are a couple of weaknesses, but nothing too niggling about, mainly the service can be slow, but it's always busy, and the staff can forget items, but it happens at all Fast Food Joints, it can be expensive when everything mounts up, but it's worth it for proper Fast Food.Overall if you are a Chicken Eater and get sick of Big Macs and Whoppers, then there's a New Heaven for you in the name of KFC, god bless you Colonel Sanders.

                KFC has really lost their recipe. Not just the old recipe, but the whole recipe. The chicken use to be moist and juicy, now it's crispy, dry and old. It's never fresh and the biscuits are hard as rocks. I had bad customer service before, but when a cashier drops your bag on the dirty, greasy floor and still passes it to you like that's ok, then KFC is not just dropping chicken but, has lost the entire recipe. I got my money back, because I couldn't understand what happened to the KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT I use to go to that was such a treat as a child. I have fond memories of the KFC I use to know. They concentrate on coming up with new products to sale but has lost their craft in what they use to do. Sure they lowered their prices and that great, but they have lost the recipe. Sincerely, out with the old and in with the new recipe.

When I reached the window, she claimed that the offer was no longer available, despite what the marketing in the drive thru menu displayed to sell me.  I told her that she should honor what they are marketing and I asked if it was false advertising and she said “Well, it’s a crime to smoke in the drive thru line and it’s a $2,000 fine.  So I tossed my cigarette.  She then proceeded to inform me that she would not serve me at their establishment because of my disrespectful attitude.  She gave me my debit card back and turned me away!  I was so embarrassed.  I called the manager and she was the manager!  She would not give me her name and proceeded to tell me KFC has a right to fine me for smoking in the drive thru line while in my vehicle.  She felt I was disrespectful for tossing the cigarette out.  Not sure what she meant but I will never show face there again.  My feelings were actually hurt.  I felt like “ geez I just had a taste for kfc and I was snubbed.  Never had any problems like this at any other KFC.

                Went to a kfc in Bedford with a few friends we were shocked by how dirty the place was nobody was cleaning the tables and when they did they just pushed all the left over left over rubbish onto the floor this wwasn’t picked up by the staff until we complained that it was health hazard and someone could fall over. I visited the toilet and this was digusting smelly and loo paper all over the floor. It wasn’t as if the place was busy with customers and a lot of the staff seemed to be just hanging around with no direction of what to do. My experience of visiting this establishment has really gone down hill. On ordering a ice cream for 3 of us I asked for a spoon the person who served me did look for one and stated she couldn’t find any and we would have to eat our ice cream with a fork ever tried eating ice cream with a fork ! It is not easy !

                Twice at the KFC on the corner of Tezel and Culebra in San Antonio, I ordered original recipe chicken and ended up with extra crispy chicken strips. I said NOTHING about strips at all. Once I can see, bit twice is ridiculous. I can't eat extra crispy anything with my dentures, so I just gave them away! I won't be going back there anymore, even though I really like the original recipe chicken.

                Do not EVER under any circumstances visit the KFC restaurant in Tours - address Rue Étienne Cosson!!After a long days traveling through France with my mum and dad we were looking forward to a nice easy, quick meal however what we ordered was what appears in the photos below - this could never in any way, shape or form be described as “nice” nor from my quite extensive experience could it be called “KFC”!The only vaguely edible dish was the French fries (well we are in France so, although they were only tepid at best, I assume that’s what they were supposed to taste like🤔)When I asked the lady on the till what had happened to the corn she replied “It’s not us it’s the factory”. The coating on the chicken was without a single herb to which the so called manager (he wouldn’t give me his name!) and who turned up at our table at 21:52 told us, with not a hint of irony or contrition that they don’t have any herbs but this was definitely an original chicken coating. I did tell him that KFC has 11 herbs in it - he again said “Yes but we don’t have any herbs”🤔🤬. How on earth can you serve KFC (from what looks like a real Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant) when you don’t have any herbs. He agreed with everything that was said I think (he kept saying “Yes”😂!) and when we asked about a refund he said we could have a coffee or an ice cream 🤬😡When asked about official complaint forms he shrugged and said “I don’t have any, go on the internet”. So my friends  and KFC it starts here! Next stop onto  the KFC official web site as instructed by their “manager” #KFC  #kfctoursinfrance #kfcwithnoherbs !Been on the official kfc website and there is no “complaints” or “Contact us” feature surprisingly! 😩I have posted this review (with photos) on Facebook

My child loves KFC so I guess I will still be visiting that branch on occasion, although I am doing my best to persuade her otherwise  , however I will not be purchasing for myself.

I called to complain, the manager told me he would record this, and would give me the missing items on my next order.Which I did so, staff couldn't find the complaint the manager recorded but said they would give me missing items,  long wait again. I asked staff if they were sure my order was correct this time, which they said it was. Again it was wrong!! Items missing and I got something I'd never even mentioned. Unbelievable, it is all recorded on a screen, it's already prepared, you just put it in a bag. Obviously staff training is required. We all make mistakes but I asked them to double check yet it was still wrong.Just annoying, when I've paid for it! Has put me off KFC, shall take my custom elsewhere

Not only have there been messed up orders but having to wait becacuase they don't have any chicken you want available more than once uncalled for.

                Should stuck to Fries.Its bad enough KFC has changed to disguising chips.But you cant even order Twister without Chips. Every time I ask even asking whats cheaper the twister by it self or as a meal?I get you dont want a drink or if I ask for a drink so the twister meal.KFC should do what Burger king does have a cheaper option with no chips.

                Went in there yesterday (Sunday 28th July), the service was ok, but little did I know that the chap who made the order up did not put the top of my drink on properly and it all spilled over onto my car seats, when getting back to the car. When I say 'all', I mean all.I had 3 meals, and when I got back, after using and possibly ruining 2 hoodies to mop it up, we found the meals were wrong.There were hardly any chips and the orders had been stuffed and I mean STUFFED into the bag. There were no boxes.The food was only luke warm.On phoning a Manager at the store, named Jo, who was pretty nasty and aggressive, we decided to call Head Office today as this Jo said things I don;t think she would have been allowed to as she was very unprofessional.Today, after eventually getting through to head off, speaking to a Scottish girl name Kayleigh, who wasn't much more helpful, we have given til Friday to sort it out.What a waste of time this place is, they don't care about their customers, only their money. I should have gone to McDonalds in Chirk instead.

That's when the manager heard her and made her move by pushing her out the way. She shouldn't be working with the public if she doesn't like her job. That's my opinion.

                KFC has always been a favorite for me...until now. The last time I ordered the bucket with 2 sides and when I got home, there was 2 gravies n no potatoes.  I guess gravy is now a side. Today I ordered 2 pot pies n when I got home there was NO chicken in them at all. Also, only 3 pieces of mushed potatoes, 3 small carrot pieces and a few peas. I have to drive 1 hour each way. Won't be going back to KFC. So DISAPPOINTED!

                Absolutely disappointing I have been to KFC in Nottingham for awhile and the past 3 times have been horrendous.. the wait has been 20 minutes or longer, it has been ran horribly wrong..nobody communicates of what there doing.. food has been cold with us waiting for it too be cooked we thought it should be atleast hot. They change items without letting you know, I got given extra chips instead of popcorn chicken.. they prioritise uber eats and deliveroo.

They had also run out of Gravy and sweetcorn as sides but the beans we only got less than Half a pot ( KFC if you wish to ask I will send you the pictures. So 12 piece boneless feast only had 11 pieces so they can not count either but missed the popcorn chicken off totally again photo if KFC wishes it . This is not the first problem at this store. It is not rocket science you only have to count to 12 and put in the box what is on the list.

                Question: When is a fast food restaurant not fast?Answer: When it's the KFC in Southgate North London.I called into this place to buy the Tuesday Special, nine pieces of chicken for £5.99, to be told that there was a 20mins wait for it to be cooked !!!!For a (so called) fast food restaurant that is generally lacking customers when I walk past and only sells one main product, chicken, not to have stock available for instant sale beggars belief.Adopting my philosophy of 'when I pay, I say' I walked out of the place and gave my business to the McDonalds a few shops downthe street.

                Went to KFC Eat in Greyhound Estate Southend.After having a bad experience ordering KFC Greyhound Estate From Just Eat the night before I thought I would go and collect my own food from them.After watching the performance of the staff wondering around aimlessly or just sitting down with no sense of urgency or gusto.I counted at least 7 Just Eat drivers waiting out side for their orders.After about 50 minutes I had finished my food and noticed while leaving that there were still the same Just Eat and some Deliveroo drivers still waiting for their orders.I asked one of the drivers why have they been waiting so long.They said that this KFC Greyhound Southend have always been slow and they are fed up with having to deal with Complaints from the customers when the food is delivered late and cold.I would suggest to anyone who wants to order takeaway from KFC then don't do it from KFC Greyhound Estate unless you want to wait 2 hours for cold food, due to their Bad management they don't seem capable of caring or delivering any kind of service at all.I found that KFC Leigh on Sea Progress Road much better and I normally received my hot food within 30mins.

                My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy tap water for 15 to 20 cents a thousand gallons and then mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste. And I know wallpaper paste, by God, because I’ve seen my mother make it.To the “wallpaper paste” they add some sludge and sell it for 65 or 75 cents a pint. There’s no nutrition in it and the ought not to be allowed to sell it.And another thing. That new crispy chicken is nothing in the world but a damn fried doughball stuck on some chicken.

                I've just had a bad experience tonight. I went to KFC with my family today, and it was around 9pm. We had dinner there because our kids asked there. I'd like to say that we left home only to go there and give them a good time. But, one employee was mopping the floor and let it too wet. When my 6 year son went to refil his cup with water, he fell down because the floor was too wet.I went to talk to the manager to alert him what happened, but he was so rude and he said to me that my son should be sit and they were closing the restaurant, because of this the floor was wet. Really? I couldn't believe that. How a rude man can be the responsible for this restaurant? Or is this the instruction given from KFC? The employees were mopping the floor since I arrived there. We were at table, but others clients were walking in and of. Is it usual? And more, there were no signs like WET FLOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!After my complain, some employees put the signs, but I went away and NEVER more I'll go there!I'm thankful for my healthy son. It's what matters for me!But, about that man, not prepared to be a manager, it was really unexpected! I'm writing to let you know that I'll take next steps for this happening.

                ","
                KFC chicken has its days. The fresher the better, although you can add some taste points back if you get creative with your leftovers. I find the batter to be better than the chicken because sometimes it's just a grease fest. The sides from KFC are pretty high quality and very flavorful. Macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy all find themselves very complimentary to the bird course.

                Awful chips instead of fries, use to love kfc, now it has gone downhill so much I don't think I will be using it again. Tiny pieces of greasy chicken and under cooked chips are vile. Sudbury Kfc needs to sort out this problem as the food has really gone down hill in the last few months.

At 1746 I was told they only had one zinger burger (I had order two - a zinger and a tower zinger) and would I like something else...I queried that they had  just 1  zinger burger in the entire store. “No we have more they’re just not cooked - they will take 6 minutes.   It was now 1746, so I said I would wait... at 1803 - 17 minutes later I queried where our burgers were... they’re just coming. At 1809 am our burgers arrived - only they were two tower burgers.   I sent one back - the server initially tried to tell me that s zinger burger was a tower - duh - no!   My burger finally arrived three minutes later.   The only problem - it wasn’t cooked!!!   I will never eat there again. Not even if it was Free for a year!

Not only did they leave out the biscuits but the chicken was soggy and the 20 pieces were all legs and wings.

One member of staff serving completely ignored me, no greeting, I will be with you soon, nothing.  I waited for 3-4 minutes before asking the young ladies if anyone was going to serve me. They apologised and said there was only one member of staff available, at which point the member of staff behind the counter turned his back to and started to shuffle the bits of chicken around.  I explained to the young ladies that as a direct result of his ignorance, indifference I would be leaving. The young ladies once again apologised as I left. I then drove to Simpsons fried chicken in Hailsham where I was met with a warm and friendly welcome, 2 minutes later left with my order fulfilled and happy. No prizes for guess which one I will be recommending or going back to.

I had been to this location once before and found it to be more welcoming than this afternoon.  The place was completely filthy and dirty,on top of this I asked a worker there at this location to please assist me in cleaning a table there were more than 4 tables empty and completely dirty and she simply told me very calmly if I wanted napkins to clean the table.  I completely stayed stunned at the response  the only other place for me to sit was the floor and that too was completely filthy.I asked her again and she then again said the same response and then I guess the young lady Ms. Miriam that assisted me with my order sent a young man to clean the table.  I stayed completely surprised at the lack of customer service that are T some of these locations, on top of this for it to be an eatery and not maintained periodically during the day and not have your locations filthy thia is unacceptable.I think that Management and Leadership should be more conscious to the fact that this is a restaurant that is suppose to produce but also be aware of the fact that at the same token be clean and not unsanitary where it come become a health hazard to the customers and this is a point  for all the locations to maybe practice a little more cleanliness through out your locations.I was totally disappointed.

I really don't know what kind of Hygiene practice this lot has but, not washing hands after walking out of the cubicle is rather disgusting.  I emailed KFC customer service and after couple of weeks, they replied with this....""Thanks for getting in-touch with us here at KFC,After further investigation into this issue, the employee that you saw went into the toilets to change into his uniform for work. The Employee then wash his hands in the kitchen after getting changed.I hope this helps you out.""Now, I don't believe this as this employee did not have a bag and why would you flush the toilet if you were only changing? and you would be touching door, handle and other things along the way so, washing hand when he got into the kitchen area seems like a load of rubbish....

                I can’t remember a single time over the last few years when I’ve gone to a kfc restaurant or drive thru and got what I actually wanted and ordered. Be it lack of correct stock (it’s a chicken restaurant- it shouldn’t run out of chicken) or simply a cock up in the order through staff stupidity. The staff are shockingly incompetent, the food is mediocre and the service is just thoroughly abysmal. Honestly - I don’t know how they haven’t gone out of business.

                Worked in a KFC for almost a year. The sides are processed/frozen then microwaved, chicken overly greasy and cooked in old Magnasol-infested  oil, meals are over priced as hell. Nowhere near as good as fresh chicken, and nowhere near the price tag. The job itself also sucks, over-worked and under-paid by corrupt management.Making your own chicken is far more rewarding, for both your taste buds and for your wallet. Stay away from this bad fast food chain.

                KFC Beenliegh Queensland is the worst store ever, My family spends every Tuesday since the $9.95 deal and we always go to Beenleigh store 9893 spend a good $42 to $49 and one day we had the wrong order given but the branch was not willing to replace the incorrect order saying I wanted a freeby WTH...why would I want freebies when the order was $42.00, Courtney the swing manager was not helpful and the Manager of the shift Hayden had no courage to back his swing manager so I suggest before you go into this store check your orders....My family love eating KFC on Tuesday and we have never had a problem till now...What happened to customer care and pleasing the customer so that they will always return..so I give this branch 1 star and advise the customers in this area if they have had bad experience like me go to the new store in Eagleby or Loganlea you will experience far better service.

                Just bought 6 chicken nuggets from KFC in Tauranga. The cardboard box they came in was only half full compared to what the picture on their website shows, which is grossly misleading customersThe 6 KFC nuggets were tiny compared to the chicken nuggets from my BP petrol station. The KFC nuggets weigh just 15 gr and cost $0.90 each and the BP ones weigh 44 gr. and cost $1.00  each.KFC therefore charge 3 times more for their nuggets than BP do. Or put another way, instead of getting $16.75 worth of chicken nuggets from KFC, one gets only $5.40 worth. Customer deception at its worst.

No alternative product was provided. Food was cold. Mis-sold products and misled at the restaurant by staff (lied to, essentially).Furthermore pursued complaint through the companies website on the same day, attached receipt and provided full details of visit. I was advised by the website that simultaneously it would take 48 hours and 5 days for a response to a formal complaint. Having looked back at it now, it's been over 7 days since my visit and they haven't acknowledged my complaint or made any kind of response. The reference number for this complaint is DMG29.Mis-selling products, misleading consumers and refusing to speak with them regarding complaints, comments and feedback. Very dissatisfied with the service here.

                After visiting the drive thru in Birkenhead, we were not just dismayed with the tatty note on the door, ripped and poorly spelt but the whole visit. I had occasion to use, or try to use the disabled toilet which was locked. I had to then turn around and make my way back to the counter to ask for a radar key, but was ignored. So I had to manage the ordinary one. On opening the door, I was greeted by a very wet floor, dirty sink and even worse, the toilet had not been cleaned. The build up of limescale was evident by the colour of it and the amount of it too. Whole waiting to be served, I was greeted by a tirade of foul language between the staff as this seemed to take priority over customers. This was the final straw, so we left, guaranteed not to return! So no using the lack of chicken deliveries as an excuse for bad housekeeping, bad language or bad customer service, shame on you KFC

The chicken was dry and old, the chips tasted like cardboard the gravey was set solid and the beans (which I didn’t even order) was congealed to a solid mass.   2 people order went in the bin. The whole lot, nothing was edible.    Doubt I’ll ever return to kfc unless desperate

                ","
                KFC is always good for a quick and easy chicken meal. On the other hand I have had many bad experiences here with both food and staff and the quality of the food can vary greatly considering they are supposed to be a major chain. Also I have encountered some of their staff who have been rude and abrupt on occasion and so I have now decided to stop visiting here. Disappointing and I hope they can get things sorted out to be honest.

                ","
                I have visited the KFC on 291 hwy in Lee's Summit, MO three times recently because they sent out coupons in the mail.  I wanted Extra Crispy Chicken Bucket for $20 or whatever the coupon said with sides and drink, etc.  All three times the person taking the order said they didn't have enough Extra Crispy chicken at the moment to fill the order, and could we wait 20 minutes for the next batch to finish.  I could understand once, perhaps even twice, but three times?  Especially when the store managers know when coupons are going out to the residents in the neighborhood.  I shared this information with my neighbors, so they don't waste their time waiting in line to be disappointed.  Hopefully management will pay attention to this ongoing issue.

                I just purchased a bucket from the Haywaards Heath shop which must be one of the worst in the country.      Everything was cold and I only live about 100 yds from the shop so it didnt have much time to get cold.    My son has always said this is the worst he has ever been to and I think that I must now agree with him and will not buy anything else in there.

                ","
                Dear KFC at 4776 Sugarloaf Pkwy, Lawrenceville GA. My family has enjoyed coming to KFC over the years for the food and the service. Unfortunately, after our visit tonight and the other two evenings in total  = THREE horrible experiences. This view has completely changed for us. The saying goes ""Third times the charm"" Well not for us, the third time has yet again put our hard earned money in the pockets of your competitors that we actually drive past to get to YOUR location. Sad state of affairs. It's important to note that myself and husband and our boys all worked in the restaurant business for numerous years. We understand being "" in the weeds"" and hearing ""86"" and things happen HOWEVER the fact that I'm writing now should be a HUGE Red Flag for this location.  1st Drive thru: We arrive at 7:50pm and start to place our order for the family meal 12pc. Chicken, 3 Large Sides, 6 Biscuits (Feeds 6+) We are told "" Sorry we don't have enough chicken to complete your order but we could do Tenders "" So we change our order to tenders and than this happens "" Sorry again we are out of Greenbeans"" We cancel the order and drive to Zaxby's - THANK YOU ZAXBY'S!!!2nd Drive thru: Same as above to the letter except it's 8:30pm and Not enough chicken again to fill a 12pc and this time NO biscuits. We cancel our order and again head to your competitors. We drive to Bo'Jangles and our order is filled completely. THANK YOU BO'JANGLES3rd Drive thru: 8:15pm You do make chicken the hard way = Not At All!!! Tonight my hubby and I actually joke about our chances of trying the KFC’s Extra Crispy $20 Fill Up with the family. We both joke about turning into ZAXBY'S and BO'JANGLES as we pass these locations and say "" hey no u-turns at the light and we could save the pain of disappointment"" YET we continue on our way to get our KFC Chicken thinking there is no way it will happen again. JOKES ON US!!! ONLY WE ARE NO LONGER LAUGHING in the drive-through as we are told  "" The car before you ordered a 16pc and the car before that one order a 12pc so we are sorry we can't fill your order AND we can fill it but you guys would need to wait 22 MINUTES "" GUESS WHAT??? NO WAY ARE WE WAITING 22 minutes or will we ever be returning. So maybe third time is the charm after all. The charm being we will never waste our time or gas or money at KFC again. End of the story …. You guessed it = We drive to Bo'Jangles and our order is filled completely. THANK YOU BO'JANGLES Mrs P

I thinking now he meaning the other cars that join the line afterwards, not knowing he meaning me .I was in that catergory. Even though the food I was ordering wasnt for me their service was poor. It could of been done more professionally. I had experienced working in the fast food industry and once cars on that line and we already put the chain across every car have to be served within that lane. I dont know your rules but we do get suspended for things like that .After being on that line only to hear KFC was closed. Five minutes to closing time the security should have been sent out to end the line to see that no one else join the line and that everyone in that lane was served. Very poor service .

                ","
                I recently went into the KFC in Homewood IL and purchased 3, 10 piece buckets of chicken which came with 2 sides and 4 biscuits with each one.  I was celebrating my Dad's 87th birthday with all my sibling and family.  This was a very important birthday because my dad has been battling Cancer for 2 years and for him to celebrate another birthday milestone was pretty special.My bill came to $79.00 which to me is alot.  I was told by the cashier it would be a 20 min wait and I had no problem with that.  25 mins later I returned to the cashier and she said ""umm what did you order i dont see your order"". Now mind you several people have come in and out the store and I can hear them purchasing chicken while I am waiting.Another clerk told the cashier ""There it is rite there ""30 pieces of chicken.So at that point because they had given away all the wings i had to settle for extras thighs and breast which i did not want, I never got any kind of apology, the manager just looked dumbfounded and offered me a cake.This service at this location is horrible all the time.  They never have enough chicken, the lobby is always full of people waiting on chicken, and the drive thru line is wrapped around the building no matter what time you go just about.I would like this to be corrected KFC and the owner to contact me by email.

My order was not done. A flurry of confusion was evident in all the employees.I asked for my food that was paid for and a new root beer float for my parent at home. It had totally melted now due to their slowness. To sum it up yes good food A+ customer service F and never go there during their rush hour. That was a 45 minute wait with nothing ordered except a bucket of chicken. Will I go there again? NO

                3rd time in a row forgetting an item - this time dinner rolls - it seems to be the high profit margin items they always forget, never chips or low margin items. This appears to be a training issue and an international company such as KFC who employ low wage workers should be spending higher margins on training. But it seems they dont care - I contacted them several times after they forget an item and they do nothing about it. Looks like they still need the profits to support the KKK.

Its either cold, VERY DRY chicken or missing items!!!!!!  Which is often.Tonight my husband drove to the Drive-In KFC in Newark and ordered a meal which included their New BOX Fill - Up.  My husband asked what was included in this meal.  He was informed it came with numerous items including a cookie.  Once his order was ready he came home and Guess What - NO COOKIE !!!!!!!  To be honest, this is no surprise to us.  We do usually check our order before we leave their car park but I didn't go tonight and my husband wanted to get the food home whilst it was still edible.  What makes this dismal service even worse is the fact that the Newark KFC was empty. On a positive note, the young girl who took the order was very nice and helpful.

                ","
                After further unbelievably bad service I wrote officially to 'customer' service (that statement is a total joke). I received exactly the same automated response advising that 'Richie the Area Coach will be ensuring their usual high standards'. He must be busy as he apparently covers EVERY KFC in the world, what a total load of rubbish.Despite honestly reporting issues with KFC restaurants all I received on each occasion was a standard, totally unhelpful, response. It was exactly the same typed response indicating that the area manager would be 're training' the relevant staff. Why do this company ask us to comment on problems experienced and then issue bland responses I really don't know. Simply playing lip service I presume. I certainly won't be wasting my time again.

                Great food, but nothing but sugary drinks.  Heard others asking about coffee and I thought their ice tea could be unsweetened.  Terrible on the drinks and they do not listen as far as I know from all the surveys sent to them about it.Only other item they are bad with is the Hot Wings, I get so many now that are 80% coating because their sizes have dwindled to 1-2 inches.  And they cost over 50 cents.  What?!?!I love KFC over any other and tell McD that they are my fav when they ask on their surveys, but I am getting tired of the drink situation, not buying over priced water either, and the hot wings I am done with for now.

                Once a month treat from here, sadly when I got there it was super busy, oh well, other people clearly shared my craving for the chicken. A sweet lady, I think her name was Martina served us, very nice, the man in front was drunk and insisted his chips were making him physically throw up (he then demonstrated this by gagging over the counter). After he left a very fat lady came in shouting '30minutes or 1 hour' at the top of her lungs and when the lady said 'I'm not sure sorry' she insisted she needed a lesson in customer service and should be spoken to by her manager for not serving her quick enough. Perhaps the lesson that should of been taught was for that lady to lay off the chicken slightly then she might not be so unhappy standing up in a queue. Even when my order was slightly wrong she was so apologetic but kept a smile on her face the whole time!  The food was good as usual, the staff very friendly and patient (!!) on what clearly was a slightly more stressful day. Thanks Eastleigh branch!

                I have been there several times. I understand KFC is fast food, but still the service must be appropriated. I strongly believe there is good branches of this company and I might have been trapped on not a good one. I didn't like food, service at all. I seemed that my chicken wings were spoiled.

The manager there should be ashamed and I would have told him or her myself if my 11 year old daughter hadn't pleaded with me not to cause a scene.

Also she accused me and my friend that we were being noise but actually we were laughing and having a conversation. So Hannah from KFC replied in a very angry and fears voice to stop ""screaming down the headset"" then we tryed to explain that we were having a conversation but she would not take any interest of what I was saying to her! Disappointed when I have travelled a long was to get to KFC about 30miles and get treated very inappropriate!! CUSTOMERS SEVICE IS TERRIBLE!!! WOULD ADVISE ANYONE NOT TO GO AS THE FOOD WAS FREEZING! KFC name: Hannah Inverness drive thru Beside budget!

                Went to Motherwell branch and my son got a drink.  When opening it due to funny taste he found a large piece of machinery, I assume drinks nozzle.Posted complaint on kfc social media and got ignored whilst other customers were answered.Called customer services and was lied to, treated as an inconvenience and hung up on because and I quote ""I'm just frustrating you"". Yes lying and general rude behaviour is frustrating, but hardly a reason to hang up in me as those behaviours are entirely at your discretion.I tried to call the customer services again and have so far been waiting 15 minutes with no answer other than being told my call is very important and I should wait for the next available agent
